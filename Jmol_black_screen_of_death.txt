3d plotting using Jmol: black screen of death

I've read through all the Jmol problem threads here that I could find,
back to 2008, and I can't find an answer to the "Jmol produces a blank,
black display" problem I'm about to describe. So here is a new thread.
...

I've been having a frustrating time making 3d plots using Jmol for a while now. I have
a server setup running Debian and various versions of the Sage notebook on
different ports. I'm connecting to the server mainly with a newish
MacBook Pro (OS X 10.6.8) using Firefox 11 or Chrome
18.0.1025.151.

I experience the following thing, over and over again.
1. I connect to the notebook
2. I start a new worksheet
3. I type cube() into the first cell and evaluate
4. Jmol loads, I see a cube. Great!
5. I Save and Quit, go do something else, maybe shut the lid on my
laptop, etc.
6. I load the worksheet just made. Where the Jmol applet displays
there is only a black screen.
7. Re-evaluating the cell returns the same black display.
8. Quitting browser, clearing cache, cookies, rebooting computer, has
no effect.
9. I notice that one I get the "black screen of death" once, I get it
in every other old worksheet containing a Jmol applet and in every new
worksheet I produce until some later indeterminate time when it starts
working again.

In trying to isolate the problem, or just to find a Sage / Sagenb
version where 3d plotting with Jmol works consistently, I collected
some data:

   - Note: Mac = Mac OS X 10.6.8, Linux = Fedora 16 VM
   - Note: on Mac and Linux, all examples at
     http://jmol.sourceforge.net/demo/ WORK fine.
   - Note: When I say WORK, I means the plots load always, can be
     reloaded, at will, anytime. When I say FAILS, I mean that it
     might work the first time the plot is made, but I get black
     screen of death or some other bad behavior thereafter.
