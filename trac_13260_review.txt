Logging-On.rst:

* Line 116 First sentence is redundant.

Intro-Tutorial.rst:

 * Line 117 'fix me by putting in some arithmetic!'

Symbolics-and-Basic-Plotting.rst: looks good!

Calculus.rst:

 * Line 623: the command here goes off the edge of my screen with no option to horizontally scroll. Maybe it should
             be wrapped manually?
 * Line 737-738: bolding the first letter of each word like this doesn't seem to render properly in HTML.

 Programming.rst:

 * Line 272: "It would be best ..." sentence needs rewording
 * Line 546: the warning here appears in the HTML docs, but the two blocks below don't, so that's confusing. I don't recall what
   the skip directive actually does, but in this case it seems to leave the blocks omitted. 
 * Line 338: I think you mean (all) not (any) here since any can mean "forall" or
            "there exists" depending on context.
 * Line 460: there is an extra `A` at the end of the sentence.

Advanced-2DPlotting.rst:

 * Line 173: This plot command also goes off the right side of my browser window
 * Line 373: ditto
 * Line 409: typsetting mistake
 * Line 524: "multiples" -> "multiple"
 * Line 592: "finetune" -> "fine-tune"
