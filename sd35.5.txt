Sage Days 35.5 Log:
===================

* 9130 (review)

# --- Back burner ---
#

* 10075 (Karen's log_gamma ticket)

* 11888 lambert_w (new)
  ** waiting on review.
  xx investigate random_expression size increase (?!)
    calling random_expression repeatedly:
    - usuall len(srt(z)) = ~300
    - sometimes len =~ 3000
    - sometimes command fails (no attrib error, no variables error)
    - Is this reproducible?
    - Does it happen without the patch?
    => docstring for random_expr says this is expected!
